📌 **Experiment 21: Sorting Algorithms**

**🎯 Aim:**  
To implement and understand different sorting techniques in C++, including Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Quick Sort.

**📖 Theory:**  
**Sorting** is the process of arranging data in a particular order, usually ascending or descending.  
- **Selection Sort:** Finds the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.  
- **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, “bubbling” the largest element to the end in each pass.  
- **Quick Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

**🔹 Sorting Algorithms:**  
1. **Selection Sort** – Select the minimum element and place it in the correct position iteratively.  
2. **Bubble Sort** – Swap adjacent elements repeatedly to move the largest element to the correct position.  
3. **Quick Sort** – Partition the array around a pivot and recursively sort the subarrays.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**  

**Selection Sort:**  
1. Start from the first element and find the minimum element in the unsorted array.  
2. Swap it with the first element.  
3. Move to the next position and repeat until the array is sorted.  

**Bubble Sort:**  
1. Compare each pair of adjacent elements.  
2. Swap them if they are in the wrong order.  
3. Repeat for all elements until no swaps are needed.  

**Quick Sort:**  
1. Select a pivot element (usually last element).  
2. Partition the array such that elements less than pivot are on the left, greater on the right.  
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort on left and right subarrays.  

**📝 Topics Covered:**  
- Selection Sort  
- Bubble Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Sorting arrays  
- Divide-and-conquer technique (for Quick Sort)  

**✅ Conclusion:**  
- Successfully implemented Selection, Bubble, and Quick Sort algorithms in C++.  
- Learned the difference between simple and efficient sorting techniques.  
- Quick Sort is more efficient than Selection and Bubble Sort for larger datasets.
